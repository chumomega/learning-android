### Basic Info
 - `app > java > com.example.myfirstapp > MainActivity`
    - This is the main activity (the entry point for your app). When you build and run the app, the system launches an instance of this Activity and loads its layout.
 - `app > res > layout > activity_main.xml`
    - This XML file defines the layout for the activity's UI. It contains a TextView element with the text "Hello world!".
